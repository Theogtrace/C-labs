Step #1:
How many errors appear? 2
How many warnings appear? 1 

Step #2:

Step #3:
Run the program, and at the prompt, enter the value 10.
What happens? Segmentation fault

What value is printed after “The sum of integers 0 to 10 is: “ ? 10
What value *should* have been printed? 55
How many warnings appear without the -Wall option? None 
How many warnings appear with the -Wall option? 2

Step #4:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1
List in order the values output by the printf statement you added: I =10 sum =10

Answer the following questions again, based on the most recent code execution:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1
List the values output by the printf statement you added: i=10 sum=10
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? 10

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input). Did the warning message go away? Yes



Now answer the following questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1
List the values output by the printf statement you added: i=10 sum=10
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? 10

Comment out the for loop, and copy it to the line below, this time without the semicolon.
Compile and run the program again (using 10 as input). Now answer the questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10
List the values output by the printf statement you added: i=0 sum=0,i=1 sum =1, i=2 sum=3, i=3 sum=6, i=4 sum=10. i=5 sum=15, i=6 sum=21, i=7 sum=28, i=8 sum=36, i=9 sum=45
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? 45
Is the final value of sum correct? (Look at your answer to step #3 above) No

You are supposed to add the integers from 0 to 10. Which integer is missing? 10

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input):
Answer the following questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 11
List the values output by the printf statement you added: i=0 sum=0,i=1 sum =1, i=2 sum=3, i=3 sum=6, i=4 sum=10. i=5 sum=15, i=6 sum=21, i=7 sum=28, i=8 sum=36, i=9 sum=45, i=10 sum=55
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? 55

Step #5:
Recompile, and run the code. Has the output changed? No
Step #6:If you haven't already, create an electronic version of this page. You can either keep it as html, copy it to a text file, or a Word compatible document. Fill out the answer sheet with the responses you recorded as you went through the lab. Then submit this document using Blackboard.
